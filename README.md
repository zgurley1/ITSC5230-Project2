Tower Knights: Countersiege ||
Developed by Carson Jones, Zach Gurley, Andrew Soriano, and Tyler Bunn
Instructions
---------------
Use WASD to move. Press 1/2/3 near an empty tower slot to place an archer/wizard/catapult tower.
Press E to harvest resources
Towers will attack enemies that traverse the path winding through the level. Currently, the player's towers must defeat a certain number of
enemies to win the game. Making contact with enemies lowers the player's health and losing enough health will make the player unable to place
or modify towers for the remainder of the round.
